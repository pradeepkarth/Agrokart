# Agrokart Architecture & Scalability Patterns

## Overview
Agrokart is built using scalable, maintainable, and testable architecture principles inspired by Clean Architecture and industry best practices. The project is designed for easy feature extension, robust error handling, and clear separation of concerns.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Clean Architecture
- **Layered Structure:**
  - **Presentation Layer:** UI widgets, screens, and state management (Cubit/Bloc).
  - **Domain Layer:** Business logic, use cases, and repository interfaces.
  - **Data Layer:** Repository implementations, data sources, and services.
- **Dependency Rule:** Inner layers never depend on outer layers.

### 2. Dependency Injection
- **get_it** is used for dependency injection.
- All dependencies (repositories, use cases, Cubits) are registered in a single `locator.dart` file.
- No direct instantiation of dependencies in widgets or logic classes.

### 3. State Management
- **Cubit/Bloc** is used for all feature logic and state.
- UI reacts to Cubit/Bloc states and never contains business logic.
- States and Cubits/Blocs are organized using Dart's `part` and `part of` directives for clarity.

### 4. Use Case Driven
- All business logic is encapsulated in use case classes (e.g., `LoginUseCase`, `RegisterUseCase`).
- Cubits/Blocs consume use cases, not repositories directly.

### 5. Error Handling
- **Either** type from `dartz` is used for result handling in use cases.
- All errors are represented as `Failure` objects, making error handling explicit and robust.

### 6. Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class is defined in its own file.
- No file contains multiple class definitions.

### 7. Feature-Based Folder Structure
- All code is organized by feature (e.g., `features/auth`).
- Each feature contains its own data, domain, and presentation layers.

## Scalability Practices
- **Extensible:** New features can be added by creating new use cases, Cubits, and registering them in `locator.dart`.
- **Testable:** Use cases and Cubits/Blocs are easily unit tested due to clear separation and dependency injection.
- **Maintainable:** No business logic in UI, no direct dependency instantiation, and all error handling is explicit.
- **Consistent:** All features follow the same folder and code organization patterns.

## Example Folder Structure
```
lib/
  core/
    error/
    network/
    utils/
      locator.dart
    constants/
      app_strings.dart
      app_dimensions.dart
      app_constants.dart
  features/
    auth/
      data/
        repositories/
      domain/
        usecases/
        repositories/
      presentation/
        bloc/
        screens/
        widgets/
```

## TODOs for Scaling & Maintainability

- [X] Create a base class for handling app update, network disconnection and connectivity changes
- [X] Implement a global error handler for uncaught exceptions and API errors
- [X] Introduce base Cubit/Bloc classes for common state management patterns
- [X] Add feature-level dependency injection modules for better modularity
- [ ] Use sealed classes for domain models and error types
- [ ] Add automated tests for use cases, Cubits, and repositories
- [ ] Implement logging and analytics for user actions and errors
- [ ] Document API contracts and data models for easier onboarding
- [ ] Add support for localization and theming
- [ ] Refactor for platform-specific abstractions (web, mobile, desktop)
- [ ] Optimize for performance: lazy loading, caching, pagination
- [ ] Regularly audit for SOLID, DRY, and KISS principle adherence
